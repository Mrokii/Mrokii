My first ever (released) Python-project is a memory-game (as in the classical tabletop-game where you try to find pairs of cards). It's been done wiht Python and Pyside2, and I was mostly learning by doing, so there are probably more than enough "problems" and things that could be done better in the code. Besides, there are quite a few things that might be good to be implemented.
I'll try to upload the version I have right now (which, at least for me, works). But it has only ever been tested on Kubuntu and Python 3.9/3.10. Thus, there'll probably be plenty of things that don't work as intended on Apple or Windows-Systems, and it will definitely not work with any Python 2.x-versions.
